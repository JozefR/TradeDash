# TradeDash

### Description
A simple ASP.NET Core TradeDash project that I am working in my free time. I am going to develop simple [Blue Chips/Stocks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bluechip.asp) trading simulation with trading sheets and some statistics. This project is very basic, anyone who has interest in Stocks and learn ASP. Core is welcome to join :).

### Domain Objects so far
The base entity will be **Strategy**. Each strategy has its own: **MoneyManagement**, **EstaminateReturn**
and **ReturnOnStrategy** entities.

For each strategy with specific **strategy type** can be recorded **StockTrades** and **OptionTrades**.

Each Stock trade can have Status: **StockStatus** - Open/Close.

Each [Option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockoption.asp) trade can have Status:**OptionStatus** - Open/Close.

Each Option is of Type **Call,Put**. And additionally each open option can be: **buy**,**write**.
And each close option can be **Expired,Sold,Assigned**.
